# Landing Page Project
### This is the second project for Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree
The Project has starter code. Lots of my code is Javascript code in app.js file and some modifications are made in index.html file.

## Features made:
    - Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list
    - It is clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page with active state class
    - When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link is scrolling to the appropriate section.

## Development
My development process can be tracked thru commits.
